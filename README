Project 1
****************************************************************************************************

To build this project, type "make" in the terminal.

After the project has been built, to run the project type: "./osh" in the terminal.

The program will then begin and you will be able to enter different commands such as: "ls", "cp file1 file2", "pwd", and others.
This program also supports the redirection of input and output with '<' and '>' when they are entered in a command.
The program also supports a pipeline when it is entered in a command. '|'

According to the spec in the book, I can assume that there will be at most a single special character ('<', '>', '|') in
a single command, and pipelines will never be in the same command as a redirection.

To end the program, the user can either enter "stop" or "exit" as a command and then the program will end.

To clean the project, type "make clean" in the terminal and the Makefile will delete all excess files/executables that are present in the folder.
